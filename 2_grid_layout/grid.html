<h2>Months of year</h2>
<div>
<section>
 <h3>January</h3>
 <img src="images/january.jpg" alt="picture of jan" class="right">
 January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day. It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer). In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.

<h3>February</h3>
<img src="images/february.jpg" alt="picture of feb" class="right">
<p>February is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The month has 28 days in common years or 29 in leap years, with the 29th day being called the leap day. It is the first of five months to have fewer than 31 days (the other four being April, June, September, and November) and the only one to have fewer than 30 days. Seven months (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) have 31 days, leaving the four previously mentioned months (April, June, September, and November) to have exactly 30 days. This means the other eleven months have at least 30 days.</p>

<h3>March</h3>
<img src="images/march.jpg" alt="picture of March" class="right">
<p>March is the third month of the year and named after Mars in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars. It is the second of seven months to have a length of 31 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the meteorological beginning of spring occurs on the first day of March. The March equinox on the 20 or 21 marks the astronomical beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, where September is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere's March.</p>

<h3>April</h3>
<img src="images/april.jpg" alt="picture of April" class="right">
<p>April begins on the same day of the week as July, and also January in leap years. It ends on the same day of the week as December in every year. In common years, it begins on the same day of the week as January and October of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as July of the previous year. In leap years, it begins on the same day of the week as May of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as January, February, and October of the previous year. In years preceding common years, April begins on and ends on the same day of the week as September and begins on the same day of the week as December of the following year. In years preceding leap years, it begins and ends on the same day of the week as June and ends on the same day of the week as March of the following year.</p>

<h3>May</h3>
<img src="images/may.jpg" alt="picture of May" class="right">
<p>May is the fifth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the third of seven months to have a length of 31 days. May is a month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. Late May typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the United States (Memorial Day) and Canada (Victoria Day) that ends on Labor Day, the first Monday of September.</p>

<section>
<h3>June</h3>
<img src="images/june.jpg" alt="picture of June" class="right">
<p>June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the second of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the third of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. June contains the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours, and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June (meteorological summer begins on 1 June). In the Southern Hemisphere, meteorological winter begins on 1 June.[</p>

<h3>July</h3>
<img src="images/july.jpg" alt="picture of July" class="right">
<p>July is the seventh month of the year (between June and August) in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar, it being the month of his birth. Prior to that, it was called Quintilis, being the fifth month of the 10-month calendar.</p>

<section>
<h3>August</h3>
<img src="images/august.jpg" alt="picture of aug" class="right">
<p>August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days.[1] It was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, with March being the first month of the year. About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of Augustus. According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt</p>

<section>
<h3>September</h3>
<img src="images/september.jpg" alt="picture of sep" class="right">
<p>September begins on the same day as December in both common and leap years. No other month ends on the same day of the week as September in any year. This month and May are the only two months to have this property. In common years, September begins on the same day of the week as April and July and ends on the same day of the week as April and December of the previous year. In leap years, September starts on the same day of the week as January and October of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as July of the previous year.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>October</h3>
<img src="images/october.jpg" alt="picture of oct" class="right">
<p>October begins on the same day of the week as January in common years, but in leap years, no other month begins on the same day of the week as October. October ends on the same day of the week as February every year and January in common years only. In common years, it begins and ends on the same day of the week as May of the previous year and in leap years, it begins and ends on the same day of the week as August of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as November of the previous year.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>November</h3>
<img src="images/november.jpg" alt="picture of nov" class="right">
<p>November is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars, the fourth and last of four months to have a length of 30 days and the fifth and last of five months to have a length of fewer than 31 days. November was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC. November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.</p>

<h3>December</h3>
<img src="images/december.jpg" alt="picture of dec" class="right">
<p>December got its name from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC which began in March. The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.</p>
